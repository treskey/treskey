# Hey there, I'm Tess üëã ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I am a full-stack software engineer with a background in design and illustration. 

In other words: I like solving problems, whether visual or code-based üòâ

Most recently, I designed and developed¬†**[Campfire](https://campfire-previews.github.io/)**, an open-source tool that enhances CI/CD pipelines by providing self-hosted, dedicated preview environments for containerized applications, complete with integrated feedback capabilities, allowing team members to comment directly on deploy previews.
